<h3>HTML Markup for that example</h3>

<div class="code-block">
    <pre>{% autoescape %}{{ "{% component 'demoTodo' %}" }}{% endautoescape %}</pre>
</div>

<p>Wait, only one line is needed? Yes! CMS components are simple building blocks that can be used with a small amount of code. Components encapsulate PHP code and partials and can be included in a page, layout or partial with a single line of code. By sharing plugins between multiple projects, you can reuse CMS components and be more productive. The <code>demoTodo</code> component used here is provided by the plugin called <em>October\Demo</em>, you can find it in the <em>plugins/october/demo</em> folder.</p>
